This is a "No Man's Sky" Glitchbuilding Tool.

Usage instructions:
* Unzip the executable file from the zip, or download the .exe from this github.  It is a super small program of only 7 KB.
* You can place it anywhere on your drive. It does not need any more files to run.
* Start the game (fullscreen).
* Run the tool.

The 2 extra mouse-buttons (usually at your thumb) are assigned now.
Xbutton 1 performs a wire-glitch (On PC that is: 'Q'+LMB).
Xbutton 2 performs a cache-glitch (On PC that is 'Q'+'C').

That is it!
